# Drilling

Think about battery placement before drilling pots and stomp switches
Don’t squish pots and LEDs in too tightly
125b Are too small for starter builds (1590BB is best)

# General

Don’t bother with battery snaps or bezels
Buy all components first before sending away for PCB fab
Add diode protection to circuits
Add Rb protection to circuits
Put DC jacks at the top not on the sides (easier to work with)
Use a throw switch on a box (instead of stomp (when making them for effects for synths))
Use screwable LEDs if possible and if using superglue, only a dab — absolute pain in the ass if the LED needs replacing
Label what pots are for what (Volume etc) on the PCB to avoid having to look back at designs
