# Notes

Originally I was going to do the wah section, but wah stompboxes are expensive, and given I don't play electric guitar often, it would have been a waste.

There seems to be some confusion over the various Shin-ei fuzzes. My research concludes:

FY-2 = raspy, throaty, broken speaker fuzz, largely due to the (only) 2 transistors. Originally by Shin-Ei, usually with "Companion" label.

FY-6 = Superfuzz. A little smoother sound in some ways. 6 transistors. Circuit sold to Univox from Shin-Ei.

FY-8 = Fuzz Wah. 8 transistors: 6 for fuzz, 2 for wah. Identical to FY-6 fuzz block.

I could not find definite sources, but various online sources indicate the Jesus and Mary Chain used a 'broken' 8TR on psychocandy, where the wah was fixed in a certain position, which added some unique filtering.

The 2SC828R transistor: The original pedals used 2SC828R's. Looking at the original datasheet:

"R" is the medium gain suffix, hfe = 180 - 360
NPN BJT
Vceo = 30
Ic = 100ma
Ptot = 150mW

For a voltage amplifier, the 2N5088 works. If you are using it up above about 30ma, use a 2N3904A (I used this). IF you want to use the original parts, be aware the pinout has changed.

My decals obviously need some work, but overall this was a good build I felt. It was good to put it all in a larger enclosure (1950BB). The only issue I had was my screw in LED that I superglued in (because I couldn't find the nut) was broken, and despite many attempts at acetone / chemical removal, the damn thing wouldn't come out. Oh well, lesson learnt.
